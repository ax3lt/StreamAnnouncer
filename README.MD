# Twitch Live Notifier for Spigot

A Spigot plugin that broadcasts a message when a Twitch streamer goes live or offline. This plugin is still in early beta, so feel free to contribute to its development.

(I didn't test it very well, so if you find any bugs, please report them to me.)

## Features
- Configurable messages for when a streamer goes live or offline.
- Streamer IDs are checked to prevent repeat messages (unless the streamer restarts their live stream).
- Server restart will result in the live message being shown again.

## Usage
1. Install the plugin on your Spigot server.
2. Configure the live and offline messages in the plugin's configuration file.
3. Add the Twitch streamers you want to monitor in the configuration file.
4. Restart your server and enjoy the live notifications!
